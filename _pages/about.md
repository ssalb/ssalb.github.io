Astrophysicist-turned-data enthusiast with a passion for solving big, complex problems and building systems that actually work. Since 2016, my career has been all about variety–I’ve built pipelines, engineered machine learning models, and set up infrastructure, always with an eye toward the big picture and, like a good cosmologist, how everything fits together.

I thrive in roles where I can connect the dots, tackle challenges, and create tools that are as functional as they are creative. With a bias for action, I enjoy diving into problems, building practical solutions, and seeing results quickly. When I’m not knee-deep in data, you’ll find me capturing the night sky through astrophotography, jamming on the drums with friends, perfecting my coffee brewing craft, or working out to stay sharp.
